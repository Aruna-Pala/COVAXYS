# COVAXYS

As vaccines for COVID-19 emerge, the focus now shifts to the enormous and complex task of successfully immunizing citizens of Canada and perhaps the best hope for ending the pandemic. As many hospitals and health care centers around the world are struggling with shortages of equipment and are faced with the overwhelming task of vaccinating a majority of the citizens in the coming years, they need an application that can provide authenticity, transparency, and traceability. COVAXYS, Vaccination Management System is built to provide exactly that. We decided to develop a web-based cloud architecture pattern application.

- **Node.js**: JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser (such as a server).
